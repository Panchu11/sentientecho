## üö´ **What SentientEcho Can't Do**

- **No Private Content**: Only public Reddit and Twitter posts
- **No Real-Time Events**: Content is from recent days/weeks, not live
- **No Personal Advice**: Provides community opinions, not professional advice
- **No Illegal Content**: Filters out inappropriate or harmful content

### **Best Alternatives**
- **For Breaking News**: Ask about "recent discussions" rather than live updates

- **For Personal Decisions**: Ask for "factors to consider" based on community insights

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### **"Results Seem Off-Topic"**
- **Add More Context**: Specify the domain or use case
- **Use Quotes**: Put specific terms in quotes for exact matches
- **Refine Keywords**: Try alternative terms for your topic

#### **"Not Enough Recent Content"**
- **Expand Time Range**: Ask for "recent months" instead of "recent days"
- **Try Related Topics**: Search for broader categories
- **Check Alternative Terms**: The topic might be discussed under different names

2. **Compare Timeframes**: Ask about opinions "now vs a year ago"
3. **Segment by Community**: Ask for specific subreddit perspectives
4. **Focus on Controversies**: Ask about "debates" or "disagreements"

### **Research Strategies**
1. **Start Broad**: Begin with general topics, then drill down
2. **Multiple Angles**: Ask the same question in different ways
3. **Fact-Check**: Cross-reference with multiple sources
4. **Consider Bias**: Remember that online communities may not represent everyone

### **Making Decisions**
